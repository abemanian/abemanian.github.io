        <p class="site_body">
            I am a pediatric infectious disease fellow with research interests at the intersection between genetic epidemiology and infectious disease modeling. Specifically, I am looking at ways to integrate spatial analysis techniques with genomic epidemiolgy to characterize patterns of the spread of infection.

            This website includes a collection of my research work as well as links to code repositories when available. Additionally, the blog includes a variety of unrelated (<i>ρ = 0</i>) posts on data science, epidemiology, and public health.
