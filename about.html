        <p class="site_body">
            I am a pediatric infectious disease fellow with research interests at the intersection between genetic epidemiology and infectious disease modeling. Specifically, I am looking at ways to integrate spatial analysis techniques with genomic epidemiolgy to characterize patterns of the spread of infection.

            This website includes a collection of my research work as well as links to code repositories when available. Additionally, the blog includes a variety of unrelated (i.e. <i>ρ = 0</i>) posts on data science, epidemiology, and public health. The <a class="in_text" href="http://rhozero.wordpress.com">blog</a> is currently undergoing migration from Wordpress.com at this time.
